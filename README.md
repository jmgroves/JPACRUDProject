CRUD PROJECT


This is a relatively simple CRUD project, demonstrating a simple usage of
a front end, a back end, and a relational database.


The concept is to allow users to create, read, update, or destroy Car objects that
are stored in a locally held MySQL database. Really, it's for me to cut my teeth on.


The technologies I used are Java as the primary language, the SpringMVC framework to be the scaffolding for this project, a MySQL database to store and manipulate the information, HTML/CSS for lookin fly as all heck, and a little Javascript to build a small easter egg game.


Ultimately, this project went very smoothly. There weren't too many head-banging obstacles or weird bugs that caused me to have nightmares. Really, this project was very enjoyable. It felt very comfortable and natural to path the information through the controller this time around.
